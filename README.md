# Work Day Planner


Work Day planner was created to day save appointments and reminders through out the typical work day (9-5), 
and to let the user know which time slots are of the current, past, or present time by using an indicating time code. 
Simply enter the data in the text area and press save and the information will stay in the time block until a change is needed.
